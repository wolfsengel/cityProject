    <h2>About the topic</h2>
    <p>As everyone knows, Pernambuco is that remote and unknown place to which Mortadelo and Filemón fled every time they did a prank as T.I.A agents and had to put land in between.
    But look where Pernambuco exists. It is a state in the Northeast of Brazil, capital Recife, the city from which I am writing this post today. To fly to the island of Fernando de Noronha, which is my final destination, you have to stop over in Recife (or Natal) so I thought it was a very good excuse to say that I was once in Pernambuco and explore a city on the way which is not usually in the catalog of the most visited tourist places in Brazil.
    Recife is a modern and pleasant city with 40-story skyscrapers in front of a huge, beautiful beach with eight kilometers of golden sand. If you read in some bad guide that it is the Venice of Brazil, do not believe anything. It doesn't even remotely resemble it, despite the fact that it is located at the confluence of five rivers and has bridges that cross them. But it has other things of interest that justify the visit.</p>
